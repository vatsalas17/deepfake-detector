## 🧠 Project Overview

Deepfake Detector is a simple and efficient web-based application designed to detect whether an image is **real** or **AI-generated (fake)** by analyzing its **EXIF metadata**.

Built using Python , Flask , and Piexif , this tool serves as a lightweight forensic utility that highlights missing metadata—often a telltale sign of manipulated or generated images.
